Introduction
"Good..... , today we are excited to present our project on AI-Powered Network Optimization for Telecom. The goal of this project is to use AI to predict network traffic, optimize resource allocation, and detect anomalies in real time. This is particularly important for telecom companies like DISH Network, as it helps improve network performance and user experience."

Problem Statement
"Telecom networks face several challenges, such as network congestion, high latency, and inefficient resource allocation. These issues can lead to poor user experience and increased downtime. To address these challenges, so we developed an AI-powered solution that predicts traffic, optimizes resources, and detects anomalies in real time."

Solution
"Our solution consists of three main components:

Traffic Prediction: Using an LSTM model to forecast network traffic.

Resource Allocation: Using Reinforcement Learning (DQN) to optimize bandwidth.

Anomaly Detection: Using Autoencoders to detect network anomalies.
All of these components are integrated into a FastAPI application for real-time predictions."

Demonstration
"Allow us to demonstrate it to you how it works. Hereâ€™s the FastAPI interface where I can input traffic and latency values. When I send a request, the model predicts the network traffic and returns the result. For example, if I input traffic=200 and latency=50, the model predicts a traffic load of x.yz which means the current capacity of network is for xyzMbps."

Conclusion
"In conclusion, this project demonstrates how AI can be used to optimize telecom networks. The system successfully predicts traffic, allocates resources, and detects anomalies in real time. In the future, we plan to integrate this solution with 5G/6G networks and explore federated learning for decentralized training. Thank you for your attention"
