*Accelerating Innovation with AI to Optimize Telecom Networks*

---

##  Overview  
This project aims to optimize telecom networks (e.g., DISH 5G) using AI to predict network traffic, allocate resources dynamically, and detect anomalies in real time. By leveraging machine learning and edge computing, we improve connectivity, reduce downtime, and enhance user experience.

---

##  Key Features  
- **Traffic Prediction**: Forecast network congestion using LSTM time-series models.  
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimize bandwidth allocation with reinforcement learning (DQN).  
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify network anomalies (e.g., DDoS attacks) using autoencoders.  
- **Edge Deployment**: Deploy lightweight models on edge devices for low-latency decisions.  
- **SDN Integration**: Programmatically adjust network paths using SDN controllers.  

---

## Tech Stack  
- **AI/ML Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Stable Baselines3  
- **Data Engineering**: Apache Kafka, PySpark, Pandas  
- **Edge Computing**: Docker, AWS Greengrass  
- **Telecom Integration**: OpenDaylight, REST APIs  
- **Visualization**: Grafana, Tableau
